                        <p>The Astolfo Effect in its core is just a fictional thing's popularity overshadowing the actual(usually not known about as much) thing that it is based on, leaving most of the people's knowledge on that figure or event be based on or overwritten by the fictional version.</p>

                        <h3>Why its called that</h3>
                        <p>The reason is because of Astolfo being an extremely popular example of this, with most people thinking of the cute femboy instead of one of Charlemange's twelve paladins.</p>

The main character is named Dante, after the poet himself, and his brother is named Vergil, a reference to Virgil, Dante's guide through hell. However, due to the massive popularity of Devil May Cry, it outshines the Divine Comedy for those not very interested in literature.</p>

                        <h3>Famous historical figures</h3>
                        <p>A lot of media are retellings of famous historical events of myths, or the fact that a lot of characters are based on said historical figures too. Thus when such series starts talking about less popular historical figures with less depictions of them beforehand, the series could end up overshadowing the original figure's popularity or the search engines would prefer the fictional character over the actual historical figure. Thus as a result this would lead to the effect taking place. This can also happen when extremely popular series take on figures as the massive fanbase can eventually flood out the mainstream all of their content.</p>

                        <h3>Mythological Creatures</h3>
                        <p>Some real life mythological creatures also are not immune to that. A lot of games like to base off said creatures while making their monsters or races, leading to the original intepretations also getting lost.</p>

                    <article>
                        <h3>Uma Musume</h3>
                        <p>This is kind of an exception but it still applies. This is because there is an anime/game series called Uma Musume which are based off real life japanese race horses, where they turn said race horses into anime girls. The horses do not really get fully overshadowed, but the anime girls are what most people associate the names with rather than the actual horses.</p>

                       <p>Sometimes fictional works take some liberties with their characters, thus leading to misrepresentation of some things. For example, Gilgamesh the historical figure, is said to be a wild man who has superhuman strength and dark hair, whereas the fate interpretation has him mainly use his treasury as bullets and has him have a slender build with blonde hair.</p>

                                <h3>Spreads knowledge of that thing</h3>
                                <p>Sometimes when people find out of a historical figure, place, or whatever from fiction, they would want to find out about the actual thing. Thus, this leads to higher preservation as more people learn and become more knowledgable about it, all because of them getting to know about it from the fictional world its in.</p>

                                <p>Sometimes when it happens to something that is currently existing, fans might support that actual thing. For example, the real life Haru Urara horse that was made into a character in Uma Musume got a big global following after the release of the Uma Musuma game globally, leading to the fans donating 2.5 metric tons of hay to the old horse who is retired right now.</p>
